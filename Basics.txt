1. what is python.
Ans	:	Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language and it is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.
		It was originally released in 1991.
2.what are the feature of python.
Ans	:	Easy to Code. Python is a very high-level programming language, yet it is effortless to learn. ...
		A.	Easy to Learn and Use

		Python is easy to learn as compared to other programming languages. Its syntax is straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is the recommended programming language for beginners.

		B.	Expressive Language
		Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World"). It will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.

		C.	Interpreted Language
		Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable.

		D.	Cross-platform Language
		Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once.

		E.	Free and Open Source
		Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official website www.python.org. It has a large community across the world that is dedicatedly working towards make new python modules and functions. Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, "Anyone can download its source code without paying any penny."

		F.	Object-Oriented Language
		Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.

		G.	Extensible
		It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code.

		H.	Large Standard Library
		It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc. Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.

		I.	GUI Programming Support
		Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5, Tkinter, Kivy are the libraries which are used for developing the web application.

		J.	Integrated
		It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python runs code line by line like C,C++ Java. It makes easy to debug the code.

		K.	Embeddable
		The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed other language into our code.

		L.	Dynamic Memory Allocation

		In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.

3. Is python os case-sensitive.
Ans : Yes
4 Is python is a dynamiclly typed programming.
Ans : Yes
5. How to perform the arithemitic operations using python.
Ans :  1	Addition	x + y
					 >>>x = 5
					 >>>y = 3
					 >>>x=y
						print(x + y)
      2.Subtraction	x - y
				 >> x=5
				 >>>y=2
				 >>>x-y
				 >>>print(x-y)
      3.Multiplication	x * y
						>>>x=5
						>>>y=2
						>>> x*y
						>>>	print(x*y)				 
      4.Division	x / y  ( Division always return the floating value)
					>>>x=8
					>>>y=2
					>>>print(x/y)---> float value
					>>>print(x//y)---> integer value				
      5.Modulus	x % y
					>>>x=5
					>>>y=2
					>>>print(x%y)
					>>>x%y									
      6.Exponentiation	x ** y
					>>>x=2
					>>>y=5
					>>>print(x**y)
      7.Floor division	x // y
					>>>x=4
					>>>y=2
					>>>print(x//y)
					
6.  what is floor division in python.
Ans : Floor division is an operation in Python that allows us to divide two numbers and rounds the resultant value down to the nearest integer.
	  The floor division occurs through the double-backslash (//) operator.

7. What is BODMAS rule.
Ans : BODMAS stands for Bracket, of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

8. what are variable.
Ans :  A Variable is nothing but a programming element used to define, store, and perform
    operations on the input data.
	Python variables are of four different types: Integer, Long Integer, Float, and String.

9. What are Data types.
Ans : Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

      Text Type:	str
     Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
    Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
      Mapping Type:	dict
       Set Types:	set, frozenset
     Boolean Type:	bool
     Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray
    None Type:	NoneType
10. Explain some of the bacis data type in python.
Ans : 1) Numeric --it holds Number
        -> int -  1,2,3,4
        -> float -  1.1,2.2.3.3
        -> complex - 1+1j
      2) string -- it holds sequence of character
            str = "thunder","soft","company",'a','1'
      3) list -- collection of elements inside [], and it is mutable
               l = ["raj",1,10,1.1]
      4) Tuple --collection of elements inside (), and its is immutable
               t =  (10,20,"a")
      5) Set -- Collections of Unique elements inside {}, and it is Mutable
                s = {1,,3,2,4,5}
      6) Frozenset -- Collections of Unique elements inside {}, and it is immutable
                f = {10,2,4,,5}
      7) Dictionary -- collection of element in from of KEY and Value inside {}
                d = {"k":"v","name":"raj"}
      8) Range -- it give range of value and it is Immutable
                r = range(1,10)
      9) None
11. What are the numeric data type in python.
Ans : Numeric --it holds Number
        -> int -  1,2,3,4
        -> float -  1.1,2.2.3.3
        -> complex - 1+1j
12. What is type conversion or type casting
Ans : Type conversion is the process of converting a data type into another data type
  eg  b = 3.0
      a = (int) b
